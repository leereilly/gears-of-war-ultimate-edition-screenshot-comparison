## Gears of War: Ultimate Edition Screenshot Comparison

Gears of War: Ultimate Edition was announced today at E3 and the website went live with a ton of great content.

**Did you know:** You can recreate that pretty easily using Git and taking advantage of GitHub's [image diff viewing functionality](https://help.github.com/articles/rendering-and-diffing-images/#viewing-differences)?
